## What's Cooking

- **Backend:** FastAPI with real-time stock data using `yfinance`  
- **Database:** None! Data comes straight from Yahoo Finance ðŸ¤‘  
- **Deployment:** API deployed on [Render](https://stock-price-model.onrender.com)  
- **Frontend:** You can hook this API up to anythingâ€”Flutter, React, or even Postman
